# Realtime Chat App

## Project folder structure

Put all the files and directories of your server inside `src/` directory

the logic of route handlers can get really long and get in the way also makes reading it harder
for this reason take the out from the routes and place them inside `controllers` directory

## Naming Convention

1. Route files `auth.route.js` so it is a **route** file for **auth**
2. Route handler functions `auth.controller.js` so it ia a **controller** for the **auth**

## DB connection

call the DB connection function in the callback for server's listen

```js
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running or port: ${PORT}`);
  connectDB();
});
```

## DB documents best practice

you should always include a `createdAt` and `updatedAt` field in your documents

putting `{timestamps}` in the mongoose Schema adds `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields automatically

```js
import mongoose from "mongoose";

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
    name: { type: String, required: true },
    password: { type: String, required: true, minlength: 6 },
    profilePic: { type: String, default: "" },
  },
  { timestamps: true }
);
```

## Route handlers

always use `try/catch` as best practice so if something goes wrong our server doesn't crash

## JWT token

send token in the cookies

## Route handler Error messages

never return a very specific error message, saying exactly what went wrong, attackers can use it against you

## User Profile Image

use a cloud service like **Cloudinary** with provides services for storing and sharing media files and they offer a free plan üôÇ as well

how to setup cloudinary

```js
import { v2 as cloudinary } from "cloudinary";
import dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config();

cloudinary.config({
  cloud_name: process.env.CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME,
  api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
  api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET,
});

export default cloudinary;
```

## Message model

for the message model we need to have **senderId**, **receiverId**, **text** and **image** fields

## Messages

to get all the messages between current user and the target user:

we need to query the messages model like this

```js
const messages = await Message.find({
  senderId: myId,
  receiverId: userToChatId,
  senderId: userToChatId,
  receiverId: myId,
});
```

## Axios Setup

```js
import axios from "axios";

export const axiosInstance = axios.create({
  baseURL: "http://localhost:5001/api",
  withCredentials: true,
});
```

The axios.create() method allows you to create a custom Axios instance with pre-configured settings. This is useful when you want to reuse the same configuration across multiple requests.

```js
// Without axios.create()
axios.get("http://localhost:5001/api/users");

// With axios.create()
axiosInstance.get("/users");
```

## Protect Routes if the User is not logged-in

here is how to protect your pages

```js
<Routes>
  <Route
    path="/"
    element={authUser ? <HomePage /> : <Navigate to={"/login"} />}
  />
  <Route
    path="/signup"
    element={!authUser ? <SignupPage /> : <Navigate to={"/"} />}
  />
  <Route
    path="/login"
    element={!authUser ? <LoginPage /> : <Navigate to={"/"} />}
  />
  <Route path="/settings" element={<SettingsPage />} />
  <Route
    path="/profile"
    element={authUser ? <ProfilePage /> : <Navigate to={"/login"} />}
  />
</Routes>
```

## Uploading Profile Image

```js
const { authUser, isUpdatingProfile, updateProfile } = useAuthStore();
const [selectedImage, setSelectedImage] = useState(null);

const handleImageUpload = async (e) => {
  const file = e.target.files[0];
  if (!file) return;

  const reader = new FileReader();
  reader.readAsDataURL(file);

  reader.onload = async () => {
    const base64Image = reader.result;
    setSelectedImage(base64Image);
    await updateProfile({ profilePic: base64Image });
  };
};
```

1. Accessing the Uploaded File:

```js
const file = e.target.files[0];
if (!file) return;
```

- e.target.files: This gives you a FileList object containing all selected files.
- files[0]: Accesses the first uploaded file.
- Early Return: If no file is uploaded (e.g., the user cancels the upload), the function exits with return.

2. Creating a FileReader Instance:

```js
const reader = new FileReader();
```

- FileReader: A built-in JavaScript object that allows you to read the contents of files (like images, text, etc.) asynchronously.
- You need FileReader when you want to read local files in a browser without uploading them to a server.

3. Reading the Image as a Base64 String:

```js
reader.readAsDataURL(file);
```

- readAsDataURL(file): Converts the file into a Base64-encoded string (a text representation of binary data).
- Why Base64? This format can be directly embedded into image src attributes or sent via API requests without needing to store files separately.

4. Handling the File After It's Read:

```js
reader.onload = async () => {
  const base64Image = reader.result;
  setSelectedImage(base64Image);
  await updateProfile({ profilePic: base64Image });
};
```

- reader.onload: Triggered when the file is fully read.
- reader.result: Contains the Base64 version of the uploaded image.
- setSelectedImage: Updates the UI to display the uploaded image immediately.
- await updateProfile: Sends the image to the backend as part of the user's profile update.

### üì∏ Why Use FileReader?

1. Preview Files Locally: Show the uploaded image to the user before sending it to the server.
2. Process Different Formats: Handle images, videos, or plain text without uploading immediately.
3. Improve User Experience: Users can see a preview and verify their upload.

### üîç When Should You Use FileReader?

1. Image Previews: Before uploading profile pictures, cover photos, etc.
2. Reading Local Files: Display text from .txt files or images locally.
3. Data Conversion: Convert files into Base64 or ArrayBuffer for processing.

## Socket.io

### What is socket.handshake?

What is a "Handshake" in WebSockets?
A handshake is the process where a client and server establish a WebSocket connection.
In Socket.IO, this handshake process includes:

1. Client sends an initial HTTP request (with headers, query parameters, and cookies if applicable).
2. Server processes the request and can accept or reject the connection.
3. A WebSocket connection is established.
