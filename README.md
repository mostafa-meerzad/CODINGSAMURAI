Welcome to my **Coding Samurai Web Development Internship (Batch A-36)** repository! This repo showcases the projects I am building during my four-week internship, focusing on modern web development practices.

## 📚 About This Repository
This repository contains two major projects demonstrating my skills in frontend and full-stack development:

1. **Real-Time Chat Application**
   - Built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Socket.IO**.
   - Allows users to join chat rooms and communicate in real-time.

2. **Full Stack Todo Application**
   - A full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application.
   - Includes features like user authentication, CRUD operations
