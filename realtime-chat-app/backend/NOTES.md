## Project folder structure

Put all the files and directories of your server inside `src/` directory

the logic of route handlers can get really long and get in the way also makes reading it harder
for this reason take the out from the routes and place them inside `controllers` directory

## Naming Convention

1. Route files `auth.route.js` so it is a **route** file for **auth**
2. Route handler functions `auth.controller.js` so it ia a **controller** for the **auth**
